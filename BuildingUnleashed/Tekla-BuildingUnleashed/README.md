# BuidlingUnleashed

Removes stamina requirements and item-wear from building. Basically free placing, removing or repairing stuff.

## Short story long

In videogames there is a thing called "pacing". This concept revolves around the idea that the game should >not only<
offer different types of gameplay, but it also should bounce the player between them from time to time. The idea
of taxing building mechanics with item wear and stamina consuption is, suposedly, a method to force the player to stop
from building, but given that the solution to this is extremely easy to solve, it becomes just a nuisance.

In constrast, a good pacing example would be "resource gathering" because the player has to stop building to restore
building supplies.

Basically, this mod exists because I have studied videogame design and happen to know kinda how to mod. With help. From:
